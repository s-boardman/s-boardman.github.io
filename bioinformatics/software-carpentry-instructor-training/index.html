		<h1>Software Carpentry Instructor Training</h1>
		<div class="content">
			

<p>This week I attended the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a> instructor training workshop hosted by <a href="http://www.elixir-uk.org" target="_blank">Elixir UK</a> at the <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of Manchester</a>. I&rsquo;ve been on one of their courses as part of the <a href="http://www.nshcs.org.uk/nhs-scientist-training-programme" target="_blank">Scientist Training Programme</a> and learnt loads. The whole ethos of improving scientific computing for more productive science is something I want to get on board with, so becoming an instructor seemed like a good challenge, as well as a boost for the old CV.</p>

<p>Below is a collection of my notes from the two days and a short review about the process.</p>

<h2 id="overall-ethos">Overall Ethos</h2>

<p>Software carpentry is <a href="http://lifehacker.com/the-value-of-marginal-gains-1514453003" target="_blank">marginal gains</a> for teaching. Repeatedly improving understanding by 1% with small simple changes, leads to significant progress over time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Progress = Novice -&gt; Competent -&gt; Expert</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Learning is about making the right connections and avoiding misconceptions.</p>

<p>Think through the implications of a broken mental model caused by a pre-existing misconception in order to work out the correct understanding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Novice - don&rsquo;t have mental models.</p>

<p>Competent - use the mental models of others.</p>

<p>Expert - create their own mental models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Build a mental model of your learner&rsquo;s mental model to help direct your teaching.</p>

<p>Identify the mistakes and misunderstandings you had and guess/determine what your learners may encounter.</p>

<h4 id="simple-lesson-workflow-that-scales">Simple lesson workflow <em>that scales</em></h4>

<p>Think ; Pair ; Share</p>

<p>Learn to listen to your room. Look for the sound of engagement.</p>

<p>Never teach alone; management and feedback assimilation is much easier with more than one pair of eyes.</p>

<h4 id="setting-questions-tests-for-maximum-impact">Setting Questions &amp; Tests for Maximum Impact</h4>

<p>Good questions have diagnostic power in right <em>and</em> wrong answers.</p>

<p>Peer instruction relies on a really good question.</p>

<p>Test the mental model <strong>not</strong> mental knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="soliciting-and-using-feedback">Soliciting and Using Feedback&hellip;</h4>

<p>&hellip;is for students <em>and</em> teachers.</p>

<p>Improving outcomes demands a feedback loop.</p>

<p>Formative feedback is a good way to workout what to teach next.</p>

<h4 id="lesson-delivery">Lesson Delivery</h4>

<p><em>Jugyō kenkyū</em> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesson_study" target="_blank">lesson study</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Collaborative teaching with shared resources and experiences in small groups. Lessons are reviewed by other teachers and feedback is shared across the group leading to improvements in teaching practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Content and delivery are almost independent processes. Good content != Good Delivery and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>Review both regularly to improve performance. The act of soliciting feedback ensures better feedback in future.</p>

<p>Video review is a good model to implement. Services like [Athena]() and <a href="http://www.beasmartercookie.com" target="_blank">Smarter Cookie</a> look particularly useful. Share videos with peers for performance feedback.</p>

<p>Every teacher has a different stage presence/personality. Who are you on stage? Normally, slightly louder and faster version of self, but not always the case.</p>

<h4 id="concept-map">Concept Map</h4>

<ul>
<li>What are the facts (nodes)?</li>
<li>What processes (arrows) link the facts (nodes) together into a concept?</li>
</ul>

<p>Reflection via <a href="http://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/theory-of-concept-maps" target="_blank">concept maps</a> creates connections and promotes reinforcement of the mental model.</p>

<p><em>Example of the concept map I drew for the patient pathway in clinical genetics</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/12/2015-12-13 16.17.18.jpg" alt="clinical-genetics-concept-map" /></p>

<p>Getting learners to produce a concept map for a given teaching point is useful for gauging whether everyone is on the same page. They are also good for summative assessment (does your concept map match mine?).</p>

<p>NB: Good practice for refreshing memory before teaching.</p>

<h4 id="cognitive-load-theory">Cognitive load theory</h4>

<p>For any activity there is a constant conflict of relative vs extraneous load. If applied appropriately <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/cognitive-load-theory.htm" target="_blank">cognitive load theory</a> means presenting information at a pace and at a level of complexity that the learner can fully understand.</p>

<p>The aim is to reduce/remove extraneous cognitive load. Extraneous cognitive loads are not relevant to the lesson and are therefore <strong>distracting</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="faded-examples">Faded Examples</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Does_learning_from_worked-out_examples_improve_tutored_problem_solving%3F" target="_blank">Faded examples</a> are a method of teaching a mental model using a fill in the gaps approach with repeated short problems. They are really good for programming tasks where the learner can work backwards from a complete example to writing the entire code themselves.</p>

<p>Simple steps for creating faded examples:</p>

<ol>
<li>Show all the steps to solve a problem.</li>
<li>Present a similar problem with a single step removed.</li>
<li>Present a similar problem with multiple steps removed.</li>
<li>Repeat until the problem solver is effectively creating an answer from scratch.</li>
</ol>

<p>Works best for well defined problems such as how to do something specific using code.</p>

<h4 id="reverse-instructional-design">Reverse Instructional Design</h4>

<ol>
<li>Write summative assessment

<ul>
<li>This is the knowledge and skills you are aiming to each.</li>
<li>What should learners know and be able to do after this lesson.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write formative assessments to gauge assimilation of knowledge and methods during the teaching.

<ul>
<li>Use these to direct the flow of your teaching.</li>
<li>Check you&rsquo;re hitting every part of that final assessment target and that learners are understanding each step.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lessons should plug the gaps between the formative and summative assessments.

<ul>
<li>Spend more time on ideas/concepts identified as weak in formative assessments.</li>
<li>What points of the curriculum do your learners already know? These can be taught lightly leaving more time for less well known/understood areas.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mini-review">Mini Review</h2>

<p>The two days were extremely intense. I was shattered at the end of it all! But I did gain a lot and will be completing the process after Christmas. The speakers were all very friendly and approachable. They demonstrated the Software Carpentry ethos fully and I found it extremely inspiring. The location was fine (flat teaching room), it had plenty of power points for laptops, and coffee and lunch were provided. I did the computer bits on my iPad, which personally proved very slow and the etherpad didn&rsquo;t play very nicely. This is possibly because the tablet itself is old and slow, but using a proper laptop is something I&rsquo;d probably consider for future versions of the workshop.</p>
